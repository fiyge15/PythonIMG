# Project PythonIMG

This project is a Python application with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter. It includes image processing, visualization, and file handling features.

## Requirements

The project requires the following Python libraries:

- **tkinter** – GUI library (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
- **Pillow (PIL)** – Image processing: `pip install Pillow`
- **OpenCV (cv2)** – Advanced image and video processing: `pip install opencv-python`
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations on arrays and matrices: `pip install numpy`
- **Matplotlib** – Plotting and visualization: `pip install matplotlib`
- **scikit-image** – Image processing: `pip install scikit-image`
- **pickle** – Serialization (built-in Python library)
- **csv** – CSV file handling (built-in Python library)
- **io** – Input/output operations (built-in Python library)
- **os, sys, subprocess, tempfile** – System operations (built-in Python libraries)

**Note:** Built-in libraries (`os`, `sys`, `csv`, `io`, `pickle`, `subprocess`, `tempfile`, `tkinter`) do not require installation.

## Installation

> pip install Pillow opencv-python numpy matplotlib scikit-image
